Place Vintaface-Regular webfonts here:
- Vintaface-Regular.woff2 (preferred)
- Vintaface-Regular.woff (fallback)
- Vintaface-Regular.otf (works too; larger, but okay)

After copying, no further changes are needed; the site will automatically load them via /fonts/ URLs.

Optional: Convert OTF to WOFF2/WOFF for better performance using a font converter or CLI tools.
